The first version of the software was designed and implemented as part of "Wearable M2M", a joint project of UdK Berlin and TU Munich, which was founded by Telekom Innovation Laboratories Berlin. It has been extended with funding from EIT ICT, as part of the activity "Connected Textiles".

Interactex is built using the Tango framework developed by TU Munich.

In the Interactex software, we use the GHUnit (a test framework for iOS developed by Gabriel Handford) and cocos2D libraries (a framework for building 2D games and graphical applications developed by Zynga Inc.).

Interactex also implements the Firmata protocol. Its software serial library is based on the original Arduino Firmata library.
